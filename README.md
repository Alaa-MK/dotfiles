# ⊙ My Dotfiles

> “The tools you use shape the way you think.”

A terminal setup that feels like home — clean, seamless, and keyboard-first.

These are my personal dotfiles that I tweak (probably too often) to make my dev workflow feel smooth, focused, and fun.

If you find anything useful here — take it, adapt it, and make it yours.

## 🛠 Main Tools

- [WezTerm](https://wezterm.org/)
- [LazyVim](https://lazyvim.github.io/)
- [Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux)
- [Pure](https://github.com/sindresorhus/pure)

## ✨ Highlights

- **No mouse needed** – everything’s keyboard-accessible.
- **Consistent colors** – Tmux, Neovim, and LazyGit all match for a seamless look.
- **Smooth navigation** – move between panes, files, and tmux sessions without friction.
- **Just works** – no fancy bootstrapping or overengineering. It’s meant to stay out of my way.
